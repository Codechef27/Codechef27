### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Full stack web developer recently earning a certificate in full stack web development from the
University of Central Florida, proficient in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and a focus on the M.E.R.N
stack with responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem solver passionate about
developing apps. With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user
experience. I applied aspects of frontend and backend development in a recent project. I
worked on a team of two to develop a single-page MERN app that allows users to play a
memory matching game from a variety of different categories. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills
as part of a fast-paced, dynamic atmosphere where my skills can be utilized to develop and
grow into a productive member of a team.
